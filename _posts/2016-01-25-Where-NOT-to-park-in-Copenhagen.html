Pretty much every major danish city now has their own open data portal, but so far the majority of the published data is kinda boring - some of the data is even being published solely as pdf?!? But I guess its a start! 

<br>
<br>

A while back I randomly stumbled upon a dataset that I actually did find pretty interesting but strangely it isn't a part of any of the open data portals. The dataset contains parking tickets issued by the municipality of Copenhagen in 2013 and can be found <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=18JRK4EbbQWVA9hRdMmwMpF281qFnkFPh11cVigI#rows:id=1">here.</a> in a public Google Fusion table. I was pretty suspicious of why and how the data ended up in a fusion table, so i emailed Center for Parking in Copenhagen and although they had no clue how the data got there, they did crosscheck it and it seems to be legit. That's good enough for me to play around with it! (with caution)

<br>
<br>
I wanted to map the data, so I needed to pull all addresses in Copenhagen and their corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates from <a href="http://dawa.aws.dk/">dawa.aws.dk</a>. When that was done I could join the addresses to the parking data and be ready to map the data using the ggmap package. The result is shown below

Not surprisingly it shows that the largest concentration of parking tickets is centered around <i>indre by</i> but also <i>NÃ¸rrebro</i> and <i>Amager</i> sees a fair amount of parking tickets. Is also clear that Frederiksberg is an independent municipality with its own parking control which is why it doesn't shows up on the map.  

<br>
<br>

It may be more interesting to investigate different types of parkings violations which is why I created the simple shiny app below (encoding danish characters is btw. mindblowingly annoying). The app lets you select among the different types of violations and returns a barchart of the top10 streets with most violations.

As you can see Dronningens TvÂ¦rgade is by far the highest grossing street in 2013

<br>
<br>
Zooming in on Svenstrup/GodthÃÂ¥b, a visual inspection reveals clear clusters of red dots centered around <i>SvenstruphÃÂ¸j, AsgÃÂ¥rden, MidgÃÂ¥rden, Lunden and BirkagervÃÂ¦nget</i>. This suggest that these are the most expensive neighborhoods in Svenstrup/GodthÃÂ¥b measured in 2014-prices.Unfortunately, the data provided by Boliga doesn't identify building plots, but by using the sales date and the built date it's possible to subset the data and get a fairly accurate idea of where the building plots were located within the depicted period. It turns out that pretty much every building plot in Svenstrup/GodthÃÂ¥b is located in exactly the five neighborhoods mentioned above - i.e. it's the newly established neighborhoods that are raking in the highest prices <i> Well, proximity to SvanemÃÂ¸lleparken and having lakeview also seems to be correlated with higher prices</i>. Moreover, the large majority of building plots in the entire 9230 zip code were located in Svenstrup or GodthÃÂ¥b, which might suggest that out of the five cities in 9230 Svenstrup and GodthÃÂ¥b are experiencing the highest growth. <i>(building plots are removed from the map above)</i>
